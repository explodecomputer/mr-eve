    abstract = {The concept of frailty plays a major role in the statistical field of survival analysis. Frailty variation refers to differences in risk between individuals which go beyond known or measured risk factors. In other words, frailty variation is unobserved heterogeneity. Although understanding frailty is of interest in its own right, the literature on survival analysis has demonstrated that existence of frailty variation can lead to surprising artefacts in statistical estimation that are important to examine. We present literature that demonstrates the presence and significance of frailty variation between individuals. We discuss the practical content of frailty variation, and show the link between frailty and biological concepts like (epi)genetics and heterogeneity in disease risk. There are numerous suggestions in the literature that a good deal of this variation may be due to randomness, in addition to genetic and/or environmental factors. Heterogeneity often manifests itself as clustering of cases in families more than would be expected by chance. We emphasize that apparently moderate familial relative risks can only be explained by strong underlying variation in disease risk between families and individuals. Finally, we highlight the potential impact of frailty variation in the interpretation of standard epidemiological measures such as hazard and incidence rates.},

However, obtaining reliable results from a Mendelian randomization investigation remains problematic, as the conventional inverse-variance weighted method only gives consistent estimates if all of the genetic variants in the analysis are valid instrumental variables. We present a novel weighted median estimator for combining data on multiple genetic variants into a single causal estimate. This estimator is consistent even when up to 50{\%} of the information comes from invalid instrumental variables. In a simulation analysis, it is shown to have better finite-sample Type 1 error rates than the inverse-variance weighted method, and is complementary to the recently proposed MR-Egger (Mendelian randomization-Egger) regression method. In analyses of the causal effects of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol on coronary artery disease risk, the inverse-variance weighted method suggests a causal effect of both lipid fractions, whereas the weighted median and MR-Egger regression methods suggest a null effect of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol that corresponds with the experimental evidence. Both median-based and MR-Egger regression methods should be considered as sensitivity analyses for Mendelian randomization investigations with multiple genetic variants.},

    abstract = {Finding individual-level data for adequately-powered Mendelian randomization analyses may be problematic. As publicly-available summarized data on genetic associations with disease outcomes from large consortia are becoming more abundant, use of published data is an attractive analysis strategy for obtaining precise estimates of the causal effects of risk factors on outcomes. We detail the necessary steps for conducting Mendelian randomization investigations using published data, and present novel statistical methods for combining data on the associations of multiple (correlated or uncorrelated) genetic variants with the risk factor and outcome into a single causal effect estimate. A two-sample analysis strategy may be employed, in which evidence on the gene-risk factor and gene-outcome associations are taken from different data sources. These approaches allow the efficient identification of risk factors that are suitable targets for clinical intervention from published data, although the ability to assess the assumptions necessary for causal inference is diminished. Methods and guidance are illustrated using the example of the causal effect of serum calcium levels on fasting glucose concentrations. The estimated causal effect of a 1 standard deviation (0.13 mmol/L) increase in calcium levels on fasting glucose (mM) using a single lead variant from the CASR gene region is 0.044 (95 {\%} credible interval -0.002, 0.100). In contrast, using our method to account for the correlation between variants, the corresponding estimate using 17 genetic variants is 0.022 (95 {\%} credible interval 0.009, 0.035), a more clearly positive causal effect.},

    abstract = {This study focused on resolving the relationship between BMI and type 2 diabetes. The availability of multiple variants associated with BMI offers a new chance to resolve the true causal effect of BMI on type 2 diabetes; however, the properties of these associations and their validity as genetic instruments need to be considered alongside established and new methods for undertaking Mendelian randomization (MR). We explore the potential for pleiotropic genetic variants to generate bias, revise existing estimates, and illustrate value in new analysis methods. A two-sample MR approach with 96 genetic variants was used with three different analysis methods, two of which (MR-Egger and the weighted median) have been developed specifically to address problems of invalid instrumental variables. We estimate an odds ratio for type 2 diabetes per unit increase in BMI (kg/m(2)) of between 1.19 and 1.38, with the most stable estimate using all instruments and a weighted median approach (1.26 [95{\%} CI 1.17, 1.34]). TCF7L2(rs7903146) was identified as a complex effect or pleiotropic instrument, and removal of this variant resulted in convergence of causal effect estimates from different causal analysis methods. This indicated the potential for pleiotropy to affect estimates and differences in performance of alternative analytical methods. In a real type 2 diabetes-focused example, this study demonstrates the potential impact of invalid instruments on causal effect estimates and the potential for new approaches to mitigate the bias caused.},

    abstract = {Background: Mendelian randomization (MR) is being increasingly used to strengthen causal inference in observational studies. Availability of summary data of genetic associations for a variety of phenotypes from large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) allows straight-forward application of MR using summary data methods, typically in a two-sample design. In addition to the conventional inverse variance weighting (IVW) method, recently developed summary data MR methods, such as the MR-Egger and weighted median approaches, allow a relaxation of the instrumental variable assumptions. Methods: Here, a new method -the mode-based estimate (MBE) -is proposed to obtain a single causal effect estimate from multiple genetic instruments. The MBE is consistent when the largest number of similar (identical in infinite samples) individual-instrument causal effect estimates comes from valid instruments, even if the majority of instruments are invalid. We evaluate the performance of the method in simulations designed to mimic the two-sample summary data setting, and demonstrate its use by investigating the causal effect of plasma lipid fractions and urate levels on coronary heart disease risk. Results: The MBE presented less bias and lower type-I error rates than other methods under the null in many situations. Its power to detect a causal effect was smaller com-pared with the IVW and weighted median methods, but was larger than that of MR-Egger regression, with sample size requirements typically smaller than those available from GWAS consortia. Conclusions: The MBE relaxes the instrumental variable assumptions, and should be used in combination with other approaches in sensitivity analyses.},

MR studies can be straightforward; for example, genetic variants within or near the encoding locus that is associated with protein concentrations can help to assess their causal role in disease. However, a more complex relationship between the genetic variants and an exposure can make findings from MR more difficult to interpret. In this Review, we describe some of these challenges in interpreting MR analyses, including those from studies using genetic variants to assess causality of multiple traits (such as branched-chain amino acids and risk of diabetes mellitus); studies describing pleiotropic variants (for example, C-reactive protein and its contribution to coronary heart disease); and those investigating variants that disrupt normal function of an exposure (for example, HDL cholesterol or IL-6 and coronary heart disease). Furthermore, MR studies on variants that encode enzymes responsible for the metabolism of an exposure (such as alcohol) are discussed, in addition to those assessing the effects of variants on time-dependent exposures (extracellular superoxide dismutase), cumulative exposures (LDL cholesterol), and overlapping exposures (triglycerides and non-HDL cholesterol). We elaborate on the molecular features of each relationship, and provide explanations for the likely causal associations. In doing so, we hope to contribute towards more reliable evaluations of MR findings.},

However, whether elevated CRP levels are causally related to schizophrenia is not still established because of confounding factors and reverse causality. In the present study, we demonstrated that serum CRP levels were significantly higher in patients with schizophrenia than in the controls by conducting a case-control study and a meta-analysis of case-control studies between schizophrenia and serum CRP levels. Furthermore, we provided evidence for a causal association between elevated CRP levels and increased schizophrenia risk by conducting a Mendelian randomization analysis.

    abstract = {BACKGROUND Extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) is an antioxidative enzyme found in high concentrations in the arterial wall. Two to three percent of all people in Denmark carry an R213G substitution, which increases plasma concentration 10-fold. This may reduce arterial wall EC-SOD concentrations, increase intimal LDL oxidation, and therefore may accelerate atherogenesis. Our primary hypothesis was that EC-SOD-R213G predisposes to ischemic heart disease (IHD). The secondary hypothesis was that EC-SOD-R213G offers predictive ability with respect to IHD beyond that offered by measurements of plasma EC-SOD and autoantibodies against oxidized LDL (oxLDL). METHODS AND RESULTS The primary hypothesis was tested in a prospective, population-based study of 9188 participants from The Copenhagen City Heart Study with 956 incident IHD events during 23 years of follow-up and retested cross-sectionally with independent case populations of patients with IHD (n=943) or ischemic cerebrovascular disease (ICVD) (n=617). Case populations were compared with unmatched IHD/ICVD-free control subjects from The Copenhagen City Heart Study (n=7992). The secondary hypothesis was tested by using a nested case-control study comparing patients with IHD (n=956) with age- and gender-matched control subjects (n=956). Age- and gender-adjusted relative risk for IHD in heterozygotes (n=221, 2.4{\%}) versus noncarriers (n=8965, 97.6{\%}) was 1.5 (95{\%} CI, 1.1 to 2.1). Retesting confirmed this: Age- and gender-adjusted odds ratios for IHD was 1.4 (1.0 to 2.0) and for ICVD 1.7 (1.1 to 2.7). Additional adjustment for plasma EC-SOD produced an odds ratio for IHD in heterozygotes versus noncarriers of 9.2 (1.2 to 72), whereas adjustment for autoantibodies against oxLDL produced an odds ratio of 2.5 (1.2 to 5.3). CONCLUSIONS Heterozygosity for EC-SOD-R213G is associated with increased IHD risk. Genotyping offers predictive ability with respect to IHD beyond that offered by plasma EC-SOD and autoantibodies against oxLDL.},

@article{Kang2016,
    abstract = {Instrumental variables have been widely used for estimating the causal effect between exposure and outcome. Conventional estimation methods require complete knowledge about all the instruments' validity; a valid instrument must not have a direct effect on the outcome and not be related to unmeasured confounders. Often, this is impractical as highlighted by Mendelian randomization studies where genetic markers are used as instruments and complete knowledge about instruments' validity is equivalent to complete knowledge about the involved genes' functions. In this paper, we propose a method for estimation of causal effects when this complete knowledge is absent. It is shown that causal effects are identified and can be estimated as long as less than {\$}50{\$}{\%} of instruments are invalid, without knowing which of the instruments are invalid. We also introduce conditions for identification when the 50{\%} threshold is violated. A fast penalized {\$}\backslashell{\_}1{\$} estimation method, called sisVIVE, is introduced for estimating the causal effect without knowing which instruments are valid, with theoretical guarantees on its performance. The proposed method is demonstrated on simulated data and a real Mendelian randomization study concerning the effect of body mass index on health-related quality of life index. An R package $\backslash$emph{\{}sisVIVE{\}} is available online.},

Comprehensive molecular profiling of circulating metabolites captures highly heritable traits, which can help to uncover metabolic pathophysiology underlying established disease variants. We conduct an extended genome-wide association study of genetic influences on 123 circulating metabolic traits quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics from up to 24,925 individuals and identify eight novel loci for amino acids, pyruvate and fatty acids. The LPA locus link with cardiovascular risk exemplifies how detailed metabolic profiling may inform underlying aetiology via extensive associations with very-low-density lipoprotein and triglyceride metabolism. Genetic fine mapping and Mendelian randomization uncover wide-spread causal effects of lipoprotein(a) on overall lipoprotein metabolism and we assess potential pleiotropic consequences of genetically elevated lipoprotein(a) on diverse morbidities via electronic health-care records. Our findings strengthen the argument for safe LPA-targeted intervention to reduce cardiovascular risk.},

We present two analytical tools for use in the experimental design of GWAS. Firstly, we present power calculations quantifying power in a unified framework for a range of scenarios. In this context we consider the utility of quantitative scores (e.g. endophenotypes) that may be available on cases only or both cases and controls. Secondly, we consider, the accuracy of prediction of genetic risk from genome-wide SNPs and derive an expression for genomic prediction accuracy using a liability threshold model for disease traits in a case-control design. The expected values based on our derived equations for both power and prediction accuracy agree well with observed estimates from simulations.},

    abstract = {Educational attainment is strongly influenced by social and other environmental factors, but genetic factors are estimated to account for at least 20{\%} of the variation across individuals. Here we report the results of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for educational attainment that extends our earlier discovery sample of 101,069 individuals to 293,723 individuals, and a replication study in an independent sample of 111,349 individuals from the UK Biobank. We identify 74 genome-wide significant loci associated with the number of years of schooling completed. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with educational attainment are disproportionately found in genomic regions regulating gene expression in the fetal brain. Candidate genes are preferentially expressed in neural tissue, especially during the prenatal period, and enriched for biological pathways involved in neural development. Our findings demonstrate that, even for a behavioural phenotype that is mostly environmentally determined, a well-powered GWAS identifies replicable associated genetic variants that suggest biologically relevant pathways. Because educational attainment is measured in large numbers of individuals, it will continue to be useful as a proxy phenotype in efforts to characterize the genetic influences of related phenotypes, including cognition and neuropsychiatric diseases.},

It has long played a central role in theoretical, experimental, and clinical research in genetics, development, molecular biology, evolution, and medicine. In recent years, genomic techniques have brought data to bear on fundamental questions about the nature and extent of pleiotropy. However, these efforts are plagued by conceptual difficulties derived from disparate meanings and interpretations of pleiotropy. Here, we describe distinct uses of the pleiotropy concept and explain the pitfalls associated with applying empirical data to them. We conclude that, for any question about the nature or extent of pleiotropy, the appropriate answer is always 'What do you mean?'.},

    abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) is a method for estimating the causal relationship between an exposure and an outcome using a genetic factor as an instrumental variable (IV) for the exposure. In the traditional MR setting, data on the IV, exposure, and outcome are available for all participants. However, obtaining complete exposure data may be difficult in some settings, due to high measurement costs or lack of appropriate biospecimens. We used simulated data sets to assess statistical power and bias for MR when exposure data are available for a subset (or an independent set) of participants. We show that obtaining exposure data for a subset of participants is a cost-efficient strategy, often having negligible effects on power in comparison with a traditional complete-data analysis. The size of the subset needed to achieve maximum power depends on IV strength, and maximum power is approximately equal to the power of traditional IV estimators. Weak IVs are shown to lead to bias towards the null when the subsample is small and towards the confounded association when the subset is relatively large. Various approaches for confidence interval calculation are considered. These results have important implications for reducing the costs and increasing the feasibility of MR studies.},

The first GRS consisted of four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CRP gene (GRSCRP), and the second consisted of 18 SNPs that were significantly associated with CRP levels in the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) to date (GRSGWAS). To optimize power, we used summary statistics from GWAS consortia and tested the association of these two GRSs with 32 complex somatic and psychiatric outcomes, with up to 123,865 participants per outcome from populations of European ancestry. We performed heterogeneity tests to disentangle the pleiotropic effect of IVs. A Bonferroni-corrected significance level of less than 0.0016 was considered statistically significant. An observed p-value equal to or less than 0.05 was considered nominally significant evidence for a potential causal association, yet to be confirmed. The strengths (F-statistics) of the IVs were 31.92-3,761.29 and 82.32-9,403.21 for GRSCRP and GRSGWAS, respectively. CRP GRSGWAS showed a statistically significant protective relationship of a 10{\%} genetically elevated CRP level with the risk of schizophrenia (odds ratio [OR] 0.86 [95{\%} CI 0.79-0.94]; p {\textless} 0.001). We validated this finding with individual-level genotype data from the schizophrenia GWAS (OR 0.96 [95{\%} CI 0.94-0.98]; p {\textless} 1.72 × 10-6). Further, we found that a standardized CRP polygenic risk score (CRPPRS) at p-value thresholds of 1 × 10-4, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, and 0.1 using individual-level data also showed a protective effect (OR {\textless} 1.00) against schizophrenia; the first CRPPRS (built of SNPs with p {\textless} 1 × 10-4) showed a statistically significant (p {\textless} 2.45 × 10-4) protective effect with an OR of 0.97 (95{\%} CI 0.95-0.99). The CRP GRSGWAS showed that a 10{\%} increase in genetically determined CRP level was significantly associated with coronary artery disease (OR 0.88 [95{\%} CI 0.84-0.94]; p {\textless} 2.4 × 10-5) and was nominally associated with the risk of inflammatory bowel disease (OR 0.85 [95{\%} CI 0.74-0.98]; p {\textless} 0.03), Crohn disease (OR 0.81 [95{\%} CI 0.70-0.94]; p {\textless} 0.005), psoriatic arthritis (OR 1.36 [95{\%} CI 1.00-1.84]; p {\textless} 0.049), knee osteoarthritis (OR 1.17 [95{\%} CI 1.01-1.36]; p {\textless} 0.04), and bipolar disorder (OR 1.21 [95{\%} CI 1.05-1.40]; p {\textless} 0.007) and with an increase of 0.72 (95{\%} CI 0.11-1.34; p {\textless} 0.02) mm Hg in systolic blood pressure, 0.45 (95{\%} CI 0.06-0.84; p {\textless} 0.02) mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure, 0.01 ml/min/1.73 m2 (95{\%} CI 0.003-0.02; p {\textless} 0.005) in estimated glomerular filtration rate from serum creatinine, 0.01 g/dl (95{\%} CI 0.0004-0.02; p {\textless} 0.04) in serum albumin level, and 0.03 g/dl (95{\%} CI 0.008-0.05; p {\textless} 0.009) in serum protein level. However, after adjustment for heterogeneity, neither GRS showed a significant effect of CRP level (at p {\textless} 0.0016) on any of these outcomes, including coronary artery disease, nor on the other 20 complex outcomes studied. Our study has two potential limitations: the limited variance explained by our genetic instruments modeling CRP levels in blood and the unobserved bias introduced by the use of summary statistics in our MR analyses. CONCLUSIONS Genetically elevated CRP levels showed a significant potentially protective causal relationship with risk of schizophrenia. We observed nominal evidence at an observed p {\textless} 0.05 using either GRSCRP or GRSGWAS-with persistence after correction for heterogeneity-for a causal relationship of elevated CRP levels with psoriatic osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, knee osteoarthritis, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, serum albumin, and bipolar disorder. These associations remain yet to be confirmed. We cannot verify any causal effect of CRP level on any of the other common somatic and neuropsychiatric outcomes investigated in the present study. This implies that interventions that lower CRP level are unlikely to result in decreased risk for the majority of common complex outcomes.},

@article{Rucker2011,
    abstract = {Statistical heterogeneity and small-study effects are 2 major issues affecting the validity of meta-analysis. In this article, we introduce the concept of a limit meta-analysis, which leads to shrunken, empirical Bayes estimates of study effects after allowing for small-study effects. This in turn leads to 3 model-based adjusted pooled treatment-effect estimators and associated confidence intervals. We show how visualizing our estimators using the radial plot indicates how they can be calculated using existing software. The concept of limit meta-analysis also gives rise to a new measure of heterogeneity, termed G(2), for heterogeneity that remains after small-study effects are accounted for. In a simulation study with binary data and small-study effects, we compared our proposed estimators with those currently used together with a recent proposal by Moreno and others. Our criteria were bias, mean squared error (MSE), variance, and coverage of 95{\%} confidence intervals. Only the estimators arising from the limit meta-analysis produced approximately unbiased treatment-effect estimates in the presence of small-study effects, while the MSE was acceptably small, provided that the number of studies in the meta-analysis was not less than 10. These limit meta-analysis estimators were also relatively robust against heterogeneity and one of them had a relatively small coverage error.},

    abstract = {We give critical attention to the assumptions underlying Mendelian randomization analysis and their biological plausibility. Several scenarios violating the Mendelian randomization assumptions are described, including settings with inadequate phenotype definition, the setting of time-varying exposures, the presence of gene-environment interaction, the existence of measurement error, the possibility of reverse causation, and the presence of linkage disequilibrium. Data analysis examples are given, illustrating that the inappropriate use of instrumental variable techniques when the Mendelian randomization assumptions are violated can lead to biases of enormous magnitude. To help address some of the strong assumptions being made, three possible approaches are suggested. First, the original proposal of Katan (Lancet. 1986;1:507-508) for Mendelian randomization was not to use instrumental variable techniques to obtain estimates but merely to examine genotype-outcome associations to test for the presence of an effect of the exposure on the outcome. We show that this more modest goal and approach can circumvent many, though not all, the potential biases described. Second, we discuss the use of sensitivity analysis in evaluating the consequences of violations in the assumptions and in attempting to correct for those violations. Third, we suggest that a focus on negative, rather than positive, Mendelian randomization results may turn out to be more reliable.},

@article{Xu2017,
    abstract = {Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggest calcium could have adverse effects on cardiovascular disease, although these findings are controversial. To clarify, we assessed whether people with genetically higher calcium had a higher risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), myocardial infarction (MI) and their risk factors. We used a two-sample Mendelian randomization study. We identified genetic variants (single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)) that independently contributed to serum calcium at genome-wide significance which we applied to large extensively genotyped studies of CAD, MI, diabetes, lipids, glycaemic traits and adiposity to obtain unconfounded estimates, with body mass index (BMI) as a control outcome. Based on 4 SNPs each 1 mg/dl increase in calcium was positively associated with CAD (odds ratio (OR) 1.49, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 1.02-2.17), MI (OR 1.58, 95{\%} CI 1.06-2.35), LDL-cholesterol (0.21 standard deviations, 95{\%} CI 0.01-0.4), total cholesterol (0.21 standard deviations, 95{\%} CI 0.03-0.38) and possibly triglycerides (0.19 standard deviations, 95{\%} CI -0.1-0.48), but was unlikely related to BMI although the estimate lacked precision. Sensitivity analysis using 13 SNPs showed a higher risk for CAD (OR 1.87, 95{\%} CI 1.14-3.08). Our findings, largely consistent with the experimental evidence, suggest higher serum calcium may increase the risk of CAD.},
